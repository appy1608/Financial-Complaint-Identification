# Financial-Complaint-Identification
Text2Text Generative Approach for Financial Complaint Idenfication

This repository contains the dataset and code for the work: Let the model make financial senses: A Text2Text Generative Approach for Financial Complaint Idenfication

Our proposed model addresses the multi-task problem as a text-to-text generation task by utilizing a generative framework. Additionally, we introduce commonsense as external information to draw more informative intuitions and enhance the overall performance of the proposed generative model. The empirical results validate the generality of our proposed model over several evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art models and other baselines
